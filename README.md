# IMDbApp (Work in progress)
This is a repo of Movies app. This app is an alternative to the IMDB app which has many useful functions but can be a bit overwhelming when you just want to get info about a certain actor or a movie.
This app is made with Jetpack Compose, Clean architecture (MVVM), caching and uses a REST api to fetch it's data.
In the app you are able to:
Browse the top movies

Get more details about choosen movie

Get details about an actor who played in that movie

Search for interesting title or actor

In case of any questions or suggestions please contact me via email which is available on my github's profile page.
