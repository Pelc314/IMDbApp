# IMDbApp
This app is an alternative to the IMDB app which has many useful functions but can be a bit overwhelming when you just want to get info about a certain actor or a movie.
This app is made with Jetpack Compose, Clean architecture (MVVM), caching and uses a REST api to fetch it's data.

### Functionality of the app consists of:

## Browse the top movies
